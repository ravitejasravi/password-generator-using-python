# password-generator-using-python
Generating random password with a combination of Uppercase characters, lowercase, numbers and special characters.
I have used "random" module.

Fork this project and use it any where you want. You can go through the logic of code.

Fist I have taken string of all the alphabets, then I have converted them to uppercase alphabet list and lowercase alphabet list.

Then I have taken a string of numbers from 0-9, again convered it to list of numbers.

For special characters also same procedure.

Then I have combined all the lists to one list, then randmoly positioning all the characters using random module takes place.

Finally generating the requred length of password using for loop and random.choice().
